# Music Releases - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp.

Use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

Learning Objectives:
- How to write React components
- How to use `.map` to iterate over an array of data and mount many components
- How to use React props to feed information to components
- How to structure React projects into small chunks


## Approach
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?


## Core Tech
- JavaScript
- React
- JSX
- CSS


## Completed Requirements
ðŸ”µ  Blue Level
- Page should look as close as possible to the design provided.
- It should display the following for each album:
    - album cover image
    - album name
    - the name of each artist involved with a comma between
- When you hover over an album you should show a play button
- When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketches)
- When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data
- When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data
- The page should be responsive:
    - showing 4 albums per row on desktop
    - 2 per row on tablet
    - 1 per row on mobile.


ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)
<!-- - Create CSS rules or Javascript logic so that if there are only two artists you show a "&" between them, and if there are more than two artists, you show "," between all artists except the last two which should have "&":
    - *Teyana Taylor & Kehlani*
    - *Y2K, bbno$ & Enrique Iglesias* -->
- Lower the opacity of the play button icons and then when you hover over the play button, it should have full opacity

<!-- âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)
- We've provided another API response which includes a list of popular playlists. Use this, along with some new components to render a list of playlists in a sidebar.
- Sort the albums from the singles and create two different sections on your site -->
<!-- - Incorporate more information from the API response to make your site richer -->
