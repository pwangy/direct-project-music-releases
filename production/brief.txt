**You should build something which looks like this:**



## Design 🎨
You should follow the design screenshots as closely as possible. We've provided icons for the play, heart and more info icons when hovering on an album. Use the following for fonts;

- Album title - 14px Helvetica #ffffff
- Artist name - 14px Helvetica #a0a0a0



## How to hand in the code 🎯
- When you’re finished with the project, push your code to GitHub 
- Navigate to your repo and create a Pull Request into the Technigo repo (Add a link to your deployed project.)
- Wait for the code review



## Requirements 🧪
- Contribute by helping others with this project on Stack Overflow.
- Publish your site on Netlify.

**🔵  Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**
    - the name of each artist involved with a comma between
- When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data
- When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data


**🔴  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**
- Create CSS rules or Javascript logic so that if there are only two artists you show a "&" between them, and if there are more than two artists, you show "," between all artists except the last two which should have "&":

- Sort the albums from the singles and create two different sections on your site
- Incorporate more information from the API response to make your site richer
